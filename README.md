Graham Kaemmer Javascript Experiments
=====================================

My own javascript/canvas experiments, including:

*   mandelbrot.js, a script that iteratively draws points in the Mandelbrot set with colors.
*   astar.js, a script that can pathfind around user-generated walls, demonstrating its thought process at it goes.
*   cars.js, an unfinished traffic-simulation simulator.
*   test1.js, a 3-dimensional dynamic field visualizer.

All scripts use engine.js, a simple but useful canvas engine that requires only the ID of the canvas object. Documentation
to come.
