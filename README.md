Just Some Javascript Experiments
=====================================

My own javascript/canvas experiments, including:

* mandelbrot.js, a script that iteratively draws points in the Mandelbrot set with colors.
  * [View Project Here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/gkaemmer/javascript/blob/master/mandelbrot.html)
* astar.js, a script that can pathfind around user-generated walls, demonstrating its thought process at it goes.
  * [View Project Here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/gkaemmer/javascript/blob/master/astar.html)
* cars.js, an unfinished traffic-simulation simulator.
* test1.js, a 3-dimensional dynamic field visualizer.

All scripts use engine.js, a simple but useful canvas engine that requires only the ID of the canvas object. Documentation
to come.
